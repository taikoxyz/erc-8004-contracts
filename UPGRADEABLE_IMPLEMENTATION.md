# ERC-8004 Upgradeable Implementation

This document describes the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) proxy pattern implementation for the ERC-8004 protocol.

## Overview

The ERC-8004 protocol now includes upgradeable versions of all three core registries:
- **IdentityRegistryUpgradeable** - UUPS upgradeable version of the identity registry
- **ReputationRegistryUpgradeable** - UUPS upgradeable version of the reputation registry
- **ValidationRegistryUpgradeable** - UUPS upgradeable version of the validation registry

## Architecture

### UUPS Proxy Pattern

The implementation uses the UUPS (EIP-1822) pattern, which provides:
- **Upgradeability**: Contract logic can be upgraded while preserving state and address
- **Gas efficiency**: Lower deployment costs compared to transparent proxy pattern
- **Security**: Upgrade authorization is part of the implementation contract itself

### Key Components

1. **Implementation Contracts** (`contracts/*Upgradeable.sol`)
   - Contains the actual business logic
   - Inherits from OpenZeppelin's upgradeable base contracts
   - Uses `initialize()` function instead of constructor
   - Includes `_authorizeUpgrade()` for upgrade authorization (owner-only)

2. **Proxy Contract** (`contracts/ERC1967Proxy.sol`)
   - Lightweight wrapper around OpenZeppelin's ERC1967Proxy
   - Delegates all calls to the implementation contract
   - Maintains all storage data
   - Address never changes

3. **Storage Layout**
   - All upgradeable contracts use OpenZeppelin's storage-safe patterns
   - `_disableInitializers()` in constructor prevents implementation initialization
   - Proper initialization through proxy

```

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy using the script
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-upgradeable.ts --network <network>
```

The deployment process:
1. Deploys implementation contracts
2. Deploys ERC1967Proxy for each implementation
3. Initializes each proxy with appropriate parameters
4. Verifies deployment and returns proxy addresses

## Usage

### Interacting with Deployed Contracts

Always interact with the **proxy addresses**, never the implementation addresses directly:

```typescript
import hre from "hardhat";

// Get contract instance through proxy
const identityRegistry = await hre.viem.getContractAt(
  "IdentityRegistryUpgradeable",
  PROXY_ADDRESS  // Use proxy address
);

// Use normally
const txHash = await identityRegistry.write.register(["ipfs://agent"]);
```

### Upgrading Contracts

To upgrade to a new implementation:

1. Update the proxy addresses in `scripts/upgrade-contracts.ts`
2. Modify the implementation contract as needed (maintaining storage layout)
3. Run the upgrade script:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-contracts.ts --network <network>
```

The upgrade process:
1. Deploys new implementation contracts
2. Calls `upgradeToAndCall()` on each proxy (owner-only)
3. Verifies upgrade success
4. All storage data is preserved

## Key Differences from Original Contracts

### IdentityRegistryUpgradeable

- Inherits from `Initializable`, `ERC721URIStorageUpgradeable`, `OwnableUpgradeable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`
- Uses `initialize()` instead of constructor
- Constructor includes `_disableInitializers()` to prevent direct initialization
- Added `getVersion()` function for version tracking
- Added `_authorizeUpgrade()` for owner-only upgrades

### ReputationRegistryUpgradeable

- `identityRegistry` is stored in regular storage (not `immutable`)
- Takes `identityRegistry` address in `initialize(address)` instead of constructor
- Same functional behavior as original
- Added upgrade authorization and versioning

### ValidationRegistryUpgradeable

- `identityRegistry` is stored in regular storage (not `immutable`)
- Takes `identityRegistry` address in `initialize(address)` instead of constructor
- Same functional behavior as original
- Added upgrade authorization and versioning

## Security Considerations

### Initialization

- Implementation contracts have constructors that call `_disableInitializers()`
- This prevents anyone from initializing the implementation directly
- Proxies call `initialize()` during deployment
- `initialize()` can only be called once per proxy (enforced by `initializer` modifier)

### Upgrade Authorization

- Only the contract owner can authorize upgrades via `_authorizeUpgrade()`
- Upgrade function (`upgradeToAndCall()`) is inherited from `UUPSUpgradeable`
- Owner is set during initialization

### Storage Safety

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's storage-safe upgradeable variants
- Storage slots are managed by OpenZeppelin to prevent conflicts
- Future upgrades must maintain storage layout of previous versions

### Immutable Variables

- Original contracts used `immutable` for `identityRegistry` (gas optimization)
- Upgradeable versions use regular storage (required for proxy pattern)
- Small gas cost increase but necessary for upgradeability

## Testing

### Original Test Suite

All 40 original tests pass with the existing contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat test test/ERC8004.ts
```

### Upgradeable Tests

The upgradeable test suite includes:
- Proxy deployment and initialization
- Preventing double initialization
- Functionality through proxy
- Upgrade mechanism
- Storage persistence across upgrades
- Authorization controls

```bash
npx hardhat test test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts
```

## Version Management

Each upgradeable contract includes a `getVersion()` function:

```solidity
function getVersion() external pure returns (string memory) {
    return "1.0.0";
}
```

When upgrading, increment this version number to track deployed versions.

## Gas Considerations

### Deployment

- Upgradeable contracts have slightly higher deployment costs due to:
  - Additional inherited contracts (Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, etc.)
  - Proxy contract deployment
  - Extra storage for upgrade logic

### Runtime

- Minimal gas overhead for regular operations
- Proxy adds a single delegatecall per transaction (~700 gas)
- Storage access costs slightly higher for non-immutable identityRegistry

### Upgrade Costs

- New implementation deployment
- `upgradeToAndCall()` transaction
- No migration of existing data required

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never deploy and use implementation contracts directly**
   - Always interact through proxy addresses
   - Implementation addresses are for upgrade purposes only

2. **Test thoroughly before upgrading**
   - Deploy to testnet first
   - Verify all functionality works
   - Check storage persistence

3. **Maintain storage layout**
   - Never remove or reorder existing storage variables
   - Only add new storage variables at the end
   - Use storage gaps for future extensibility

4. **Version your implementations**
   - Update `getVersion()` for each new implementation
   - Keep track of which versions are deployed where
   - Document breaking changes

### For Operators

1. **Backup before upgrades**
   - Export critical data before upgrading
   - Have rollback plan ready
   - Test upgrade on fork first

2. **Secure owner keys**
   - Owner can upgrade contracts
   - Use multi-sig or timelock for production
   - Consider transferring ownership to governance

3. **Monitor after upgrades**
   - Verify version changed correctly
   - Check that all functions still work
   - Monitor for unexpected behavior

## Migration from Original Contracts

If you have existing non-upgradeable contracts deployed:

1. **Cannot upgrade existing deployments**
   - Original contracts don't have proxy pattern
   - Must deploy new upgradeable versions

2. **Data migration options**
   - Export data from old contracts
   - Recreate state in new contracts
   - Consider keeping old contracts for historical data

3. **Communication**
   - Inform users of new addresses
   - Update documentation
   - Redirect traffic to new deployments
